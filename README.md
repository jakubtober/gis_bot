# gis_bot
Bot that shares warnings in Social Media posted on Główny Inspektorat Stanitarny webiste about possible food contamination. When my wife was pregnant and later our daughter born I needed
a way to warn us regarding foods/products that can be potentially dangerous. Decided that FB notifications are quite good solution for me so I set up bot in Python and deployed in on Heroku.
